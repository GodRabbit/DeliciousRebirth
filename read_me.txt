"Delicous Rebirth" is a platformer game made by Dor "GodRabbit" Shlush, 
it is game jam entry for the Extra Credits Game Jam #3,
it was made using the Godot 3 engine,
and it is released under the Gnu license (see "COPYING.txt")

The game is completely open source, and you can find it on GitHub in this link:
https://github.com/GodRabbit/DeliciousRebirth

I worked on it completely alone, made all the programming and graphic assets "from scratch"
(up to the simple physics code for the player which I highly modified, the fonts and sound effects)
and I had tons of fun!

Hope you enjoy the project, leave a comment on the itch.io page for any suggestions or criticim,
I would really love to hear what you have to say!

p.s. I'm sorry there isn't any soundtrack, I don't really know enough about music to create 
something like that and as I said, I worked on it completely alone.
Maybe in the next game jam ill have more experience with that.
