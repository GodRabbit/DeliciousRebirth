CYCLES

seasons, evolution, change, circle, repetition, day-night
BiCycle

Ice Cream Warrior
go through 3 cycles:
IceCream, melting icecream, only the cone

You are a floating jumping ice cream, you need to collect all the happy-beans!!
as the day pass by, night and day shifts and you need to watch out as you melt, when you are melted away or died you teleport back to the start [as a fresh ice cream!]
watch out for the melting meter
Dying won't restart the day cycle
there's a timer
You can't lose this game
the game ends when you collect all the beans
you need to try to get the best time you can
[ you should be able to finish the game in about 10 minutes the first time]

There are hot surfaces which melts you quicker

As you are melting you get shorter, making it possible to pass through areas you couldn't pass before
trying to improve as you get better at jumping\not dying, and try to abuse the day-night cycle for your winning condition
